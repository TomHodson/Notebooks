# Notebooks
A collection of miscellaneous and scientific IPython notebooks

#### Extended investigation data analysis.ipynb
The data analysis from a simple physics experiment to determine the wavelength of laser light by measuring diffraction patterns. Uses Pandas to pull the data from a google docs spreadsheet.

#### Thermisor calibration.ipynb
I taped 3 10k thermistors and a well callibrated thermocouple to a copper pot using aluminum tape, wrapped the whole thing in a dry towel and filled it with hot water. In order to callibrate the thermistors against the thermocouple.

#### Realtime Plotter.ipynb
A slightly buggy way to plot data from the serial port in real time in the notebook.

#### French vs English vocabulary in Mulan.ipynb
After watching Mulan in both languages I decided to try to compare the two.

#### Electronics/Simple filters.ipynb
Code to parse common component values (1k, 10mF, 1uF, 2Mhz, 5V) and to graph the frequency response of simple passive filter networks. Inspired by reading the first few chapters of The Art of Electronics.

#### Diffraction patterns.ipynb
Calculates the diffraction patterns (2d fourier transforms) of letters of the alphabet.

#### Sympy scratchpad.ipynb
A personal reference for doing things in sympy.



## Half finished

#### fourier transform microphone.ipynb
An attempt to get the input from a microphone in python and plot its fourier transform

#### Meniscus.ipynb
Working through the theory of why a meniscus forms and how to calculate the shape numerically.
